# Wireless-Power-Transmission
The objective of this project to deliver Wire-free power to grant mobility and freedom to roam where you want to without worrying about your battery powered devices running out of a charge. Transmitters give you the freedom to receive wireless power within a charging zone without having to surrender your device to a pad or static location.
